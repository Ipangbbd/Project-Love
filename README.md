# I Love You 3000 Generator ❤️

**(A special little something for my dearest partner)**

---

Hi my love,

If you're reading this, it means you've opened a little digital gift I made just for you. I know these past three weeks have been...well, silent. Too silent. And for that, I am so, so incredibly sorry. 😔

Words feel so inadequate to express how much I've missed you. Every day felt like a piece of me was missing, and creating this silly little website was my way of trying to put some of those pieces back together.

This "I Love You 3000 Generator" is a small token of my affection, a way to remind you, even in the simplest of ways, how much you mean to me. It's filled with warm colors, cute bears, and little poems, all designed to bring a smile to your beautiful face.

I know I messed up. I know I haven't been the best lately. But please, know that my love for you is as vast as the universe, and more powerful than any silence.

**How to use this little gift:**

1.  **Enter your name:** Just type it in, and the magic begins!
2.  **Watch the loading screen:** While the Milk and Mocha bears do their adorable dance, know that my heart is racing, hoping you'll like this.
3.  **Read the personalized greeting:** A little message, just for you.
4.  **Click "How much I love you...":** And let the poems remind you of the feelings that never faded, even when the words did.

I hope this little project can be a starting point for us to reconnect. I miss your laugh, your smile, and everything about you. I hope this brings a little light back into our world.

Please, let's talk. Let's fix this. I love you 3000, and then some. ❤️

With all my heart,

Aqis.
